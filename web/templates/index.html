				<p> Hey there ðŸ‘‹. My name is <a href="https://manders.us">Matt Anderson</a>. </p>
				<p> I'm an Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://cloud.com">cloud.com</a> and a lifelong tinkerer
					of Linux systems. </p>
				<hr>
				<p> Business software infrastructure is complicated. </p>
				<p> The rise of VPS, Cloud, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Serverless enable complex deployments
					that are more scalable and cost efficient in specialized scenarios. </p>
				<p> But also create a more difficult ecosystem to navigate. </p>
				<p> To address this, I'm offering services as an experienced engineer and communicator to remove this
					complexity from your plate.</p>
				<p> I'll set up your deployments, provide live support, and guide you when its time to scale.</p>
				<p> Most importantly, I'll give you peace of mind. Your infra is in good hands.</p>
				<p> I'll meet your unique requirements, in the cloud or on prem.</p>
				<p> No sales teams, corporate friction, or profit squeezing. Just my extensive experience and attention
					to your needs. </p>

				<p> Any serious inquiries please send an email. We'll just talk.</p>
